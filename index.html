				<p>In 2016, I did not receive a departmental fellowship in 2016 for the doctoral program at MIT, nor did I receive an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship.</p>
				<p>In 2016, I was not offered admission to doctoral programs in economics at Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, NYU, Columbia, Yale, Brown, UPenn, Michigan, or Duke, nor at the business schools of Harvard, NYU, or Chicago.</p>
				<p>In 2014, I was not offered a pre-doctoral research position with Johannes Haushofer and Jeremy Shapiro.</p>
				<p>In 2014, I declared in a job application that I had earned undergraduate <i>summa cum laude</i>, when in fact I earned no Latin honors. I misunderstood how honors were assigned.</p>
				<p>In 2014, I added <span style="font-variant:small-caps">STATA</span> to my resume before I had any experience with it. I do not regret having done so, and I did subsequently perform well on a <span style="font-variant:small-caps">STATA</span> assessment.</p>
				<p>In 2013, I did not apply to the Honors program in Economics at the University of Washington, nor did I take any graduate-level courses.</p>
				<p>From 2007â€“2012, I was mostly unemployed and out of school.</p>
				<p>In 2005, I was dismissed from Whitman College for poor academic performance.</p>
