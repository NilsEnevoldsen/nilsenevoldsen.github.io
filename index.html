					I did not receive a departmental fellowship in 2016 for the doctoral program at <span class="sc">mit</span>, nor did I receive an <span class="sc">nsf</span> Graduate Research Fellowship.</p>
				<p>
					<span class="date">2016</span>
					I was not offered admission to doctoral programs in economics at Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, <span class="sc">nyu</span>, Columbia, Yale, Brown, UPenn, Michigan, or Duke, nor at the business schools of Harvard, <span class="sc">nyu</span>, or Chicago.</p>
				<p>
					<span class="date">2014</span>
					I was not offered a pre-doctoral research position with Johannes Haushofer and Jeremy Shapiro.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="date">2014</span>
					I declared in a job application that I had earned undergraduate <i>summa cum laude</i>, when in fact I earned no Latin honors. I misunderstood how honors were assigned.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="date">2014</span>
					I added <span class="sc">stata</span> to my resume before I had any experience with it. I do not regret having done so, and I did subsequently perform well on a <span class="sc">stata</span> assessment.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="date">2013</span>
					I did not apply to the Honors program in Economics at the University of Washington, nor did I take any graduate-level courses.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="date">2007–12</span>
					I was mostly unemployed and out of school.
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="date">2005</span>
					I was dismissed from Whitman College for poor academic performance.
